This simple utility finds the shows airing in the current block of 4 hours and then searches twitter to see what people are saying about them

Some code and ideas taken from Shankar Ambady

It is somewhat buggy and doesn't do a great job of deciding if a tweet is about a show or simple uses words in the show title.

The data I am using to train the classifier comes from:
